## Introduction
This project details a study undertaken to understand whether a camera placed at a bicycle bay could be used to remotely inform cyclists of available parking spaces at that bicycle bay. In order to accomplish this, a deep learning model was developed and trained to detect bicycles. The idea being, that if the number of bicycles can be accurately obtained at a specific bicycle bay and there is previous knowledge regarding the number of parking spaces at that bicycle bay, then the difference between these numbers is the number of available parking spaces. This number can then be pushed - along with the device's location - to a popular mapping application for public use. The aim of this project, however, is not the design of this entire system, but instead the design and deployment of this system’s deep learning capability.

The motivation for this project is twofold. As a cyclist myself, my friends and I understand the difficulty with locating bicycle parking in a large city. There are many available spaces throughout the city, but they can be difficult to find and are often filled at popular locations. Having the ability to both locate traditional bicycle bays and know whether they have available parking spaces would significantly reduce the friction associated with cycling to new destinations in London.
Additionally, a similar system is already in use by London's self-service bike-sharing scheme, Santander Cycles. Although this scheme is enabled through a system of docking stations throughout the city instead of computer vision, the end result is the same - live data pushed to your favourite wayfinding app that shows a cyclist the location and availability of bicycles or parking at the Santander Cycle stations throughout the city. This feature is shown, below, in Figure 1.


## Research Question
Can a camera deployed near a bicycle bay accurately detect the number of bicycles parked at that bicycle bay, and therefore, help in determining the number of available parking spaces?

## Application Overview
Thinking back to the various application diagrams you have seen through the module - how would you describe an overview of the building blocks of your project - how do they connect, what do the component parts include.

Tip: probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to convey your design!

## Data
Describe what data sources you have used and any cleaning, wrangling or organising you have done. Including some examples of the data helps others understand what you have been working with.

Tip: probably ~200 words and images of what the data 'looks like' are good!

## Model
This is a Deep Learning project! What model architecture did you use? Did you try different ones? Why did you choose the ones you did?

Tip: probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to describe your model!

## Experiments
What experiments did you run to test your project? What parameters did you change? How did you measure performance? Did you write any scripts to evaluate performance? Did you use any tools to evaluate performance? Do you have graphs of results?

Tip: probably ~300 words and graphs and tables are usually good to convey your results!

## Results and Observations
Synthesis the main results and observations you made from building the project. Did it work perfectly? Why not? What worked and what didn't? Why? What would you do next if you had more time?

Tip: probably ~300 words and remember images and diagrams bring results to life!
